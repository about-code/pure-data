/**
 * This class is a fork of dijit/Destroyable making the list of cleanup methods
 * configurable on the Destroyable prototype. Original Destroyable assumes that
 * the cleanup function provided with a handle is named either "destroyRecursive",
 * "destroy" or "remove". This prevents usage of Destroyable's `own()` to
 * register handles from third-party libraries where the cleanup method of the
 * handle may be named "dispose", "release", "unsubscribe" or the like.
