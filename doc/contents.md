Pure-Data is a data modeling library for JavaScript.

### Preface

Throughout the guide function signatures will be given in TypeScript (TS) syntax but where possible without parameternames. So when we would write `function(foo?:MyType)` in TS we will use `function(?:MyType)` in the tutorial, since most of the time the parameter name itself isn't needed to understand how to call a function.
